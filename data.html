        <p>Autopilot collects data through many different sensors and cameras. It has ultrasonic sensors in the front, and is surrounded by cameras which all together cover 360 degrees of vision. The different cameras have between 50 and 250 meters of range.</p>

        <p>Data is transformed in the tesla by its proprietary processor which is said to be 40x faster than its previous iteration. Tesla uses its neural net network to which compiles all of the data. Data from the cameras and sensors is converted into integer values so that distances can be found. </p>

        <h1 id="bottom"> Data Usage and Concerns</h1>
        <p>Autopilot uses data to map distances with the car in front of you and maintain following distances and speed. It also uses pictures from lane marking to keep the car within the lane. Another way it uses data is by giving you suggested routes based on where you frequently go. This brings rise to a data concern because the tesla is able to see everywhere you go and even knows your home address when you connect it to your charger at home. This is a major data concern because your location can be easily leaked.  </p>
