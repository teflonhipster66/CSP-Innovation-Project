        <h1 id="title">Beneficial Effect</h1>

        <p>One beneficial effect of Autopilot is that it can be there when drivers are not. Because autopilot has constant monitoring, it is more attentive than a human being, meaning that even if a driver is distracted autopilot is paying attention. This is beneficial because it adds an extra layer of security while on the road.  </p>

    <div class="main2" >
        <p>One harmful effect of autopilot is that people can become too reliant on it and will relax too much while driving. Inattentiveness on the road can be dangerous because if autopilot shuts off or makes an error and you donâ€™t realize, you could crash your car.  This recently happened where autopilot turned off and since the driver was not paying attention, he drove off of a cliff. This threat is a very harmful effect of autopilot.</p>

        <h1 id="bottom"> Impact</h1>
        <p>The impact of autopilot is that it makes driving much safer, and has revolutionized the way the roads work. If in the future more cars have autopilot, they may have the capacity to learn off of each other and coordinate themselves. This means that all cars could be in sync. Overall the impact of autopilot is that since it is the first of its kind, it has the ability to revolutionize the future.  </p>
