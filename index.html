        <p>Autopilot functions by data being taken in through various cameras and ultrasonic sensors around the car and is then analyzed in real time. Then the car decides what actions to take based upon the data and user inputs. User inputs can include changes in the steering wheel, and the user selected speed and following distance. Finally autopilot uses its proprietary processor which is 40x faster than traditional chips to make decisions and adjust the 
            speed and direction of the wheels according to the data it is given.</p>
